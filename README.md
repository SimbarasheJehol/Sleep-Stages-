This repo holds the work associated with my Computer Science Honours Research Project.The problem of detecting sleep orders is the main focus using deep learning models RNN and CNN and some machine learning algorithms.Thanks to Andrew Ng and deeplearning.ai l expect to produce novel work.The support Wits Rail Lab has given me is priceless thanks Benji,Steve,Richard and Pravesh not forget the sweet chats with Brandon.
